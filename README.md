The portfolio website is my simple front-end project I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The main purpose of the site to showcase some of the CTF challenges I have been working on and also some recent projects of mine! 

Note: A "Dockerfile" is included in this repo for learning purposes, allowing me to build and run the site inside a Docker container locally.
